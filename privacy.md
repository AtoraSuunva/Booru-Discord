# BooruBot Privacy Policy

Last Updated & Effective as of: September 1, 2022

For Discord Bot: BooruBot#9381 (204722411403345920)

---

BooruBot stores the following data, for the following reasons:
  - `reference_id`: Either a guild ID (when used in guilds) or a user ID (when used in DMs), used to track which config belongs to who
  - `tags`: To know which tags have been blacklisted
  - `sites`: To know which sites have been blacklisted
  - `min_score`: To know the minimum score posts need to be posted
  - `allow_nsfw`: To know if NSFW can be posted in age-restricted channels or DMs

All data stored by BooruBot can be deleted by running `/config delete` on Discord and confirming the deletion in-guild by someone with `Manage Server` permissions.

Config data for a guild is stored for 10 days after BooruBot is removed from a guild, unless the bot is re-invited.

Data deleted manually (via `/config delete`) or automatically (after 10 days of not being in the guild) is deleted permanently.

For a copy of your data, or to delete the data by request, you may contact the developer. Please note that you may be required to verify your identity and/or your permissions on a server before requests can be completed, to avoid unauthorized access or deletion of data.

[Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) also applies while using Discord
